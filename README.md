### Version 3.0 includes these major changes

- a new master/slave dynamics with better dialogues
- daily needs for the master (sex, punishment, food, gold)
- tracking of master mood and trust 
- personality profiles for the master (from caring to sadistic)
- privileges granted by the master. The Player will have to work and ask for permission for anything from eating to being able to wield a weapon to protect your master.
- a better leash system based on the collar (with fixed radius leash and timed roaming modes)
- better interactions and dialogues with NPCs while enslaved
- a progressive slavery level, from rebelious to totally submissive. This will track exposure to being a slave and cooldown after being released (if you are free for too long, you will have to start from scratch at the next enslavement)
- an API for modders to trigger enslavement and control the dialogues from other mods
- many bug fixes and small adjustments
